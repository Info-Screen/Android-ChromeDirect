# Android-ChromeDirect
Avoid [Chrome Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs) and open websites directly in Google Chrome

## Installation
Build the app youself using Android Studio, or get a build from the Release Section. Copy the APK file to your phone and install it.

For it to work it needs to be the default Browser. Go to `Settings` -> `Apps` -> <Click on the settings Icon> ->  `Browser app`,
and select `Chrome Direct` as the default browser.

That's it.
